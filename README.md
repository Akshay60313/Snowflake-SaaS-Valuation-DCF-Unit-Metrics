## 📊 Executive Summary
This project is a comprehensive **bottoms-up financial valuation** of Snowflake Inc. (NYSE: SNOW), projecting the company's financials from FY2026 to FY2031. 

The objective was to determine the intrinsic value of the company amidst decelerating revenue growth and determining if the current market premium (~20x Revenue) is justified by its Unit Economics.

**Key Findings:**
* **Intrinsic Value (Base Case):** ~$190/share (vs. Market Price of ~$250).
* **Implied Premium:** The model identifies a ~30% "Growth Premium" currently priced in by the market.
* **Unit Economics:** Despite high upfront S&M spend, the model calculates an elite **LTV/CAC ratio of >4.8x**, driven by 125% Net Revenue Retention.
* **Efficiency:** The company maintains a "Rule of 40" score >50% throughout the projection period, validating the "Quality Growth" thesis.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture & Methodology

The model is structured across 7 integrated tabs, following Investment Banking / FP&A best practices:

### 1. 3-Statement Projection (GAAP & Non-GAAP)
* **Revenue Model:** Modeled revenue deceleration from ~28% (FY26) to ~12% (FY31) using a waterfall approach.
* **Cost Structure:** Built dynamic operating leverage scenarios. R&D and S&M expenses are modeled to decrease as a % of revenue, driving Non-GAAP Operating Margins from **13% to 26%**.
* **Balance Sheet & Cash Flow:** Specifically modeled the **Working Capital impact of Deferred Revenue**, capturing the massive cash float generated by upfront enterprise contracts.

### 2. SaaS Unit Economics (The "Engine")
A deep dive into the efficiency of Snowflake's "Land and Expand" consumption model:
* **Implied Customer Build:** Reverse-engineered customer counts based on ARPA growth.
* **LTV / CAC:** Calculated at **4.8x**, proving long-term profitability despite high acquisition costs.
* **Payback Period:** Modeled at **~50 months**. Note: This higher-than-average period reflects the consumption-model revenue lag (revenue is recognized slowly, but S&M is paid upfront).
* **Rule of 40:** Analyzed the correlation between FCF Margin expansion and Growth deceleration.

### 3. Valuation (DCF & Sensitivity)
* **Methodology:** 5-Year Discounted Cash Flow (DCF).
* **WACC:** Used 8.5% (Base) vs. 9.5% (Conservative) to verify sensitivity.
* **Terminal Value:** 4.0% Perpetuity Growth rate.
* **Result:** The Sensitivity Analysis table highlights that the current market price (~$250) implies either a WACC of <7.5% or perpetual growth >5%.

## 📈 Key Scenarios

| Metric | Bear Case | **Base Case** | Bull Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal Growth** | 3.0% | **4.0%** | 5.0% |
| **WACC** | 9.5% | **8.5%** | 7.5% |
| **Implied Price** | ~$154 | **~$190** | ~$250+ |

## 🧠 Strategic Insights & Defense
* **Why the Low Magic Number (0.6x)?**
    * The model highlights a low Magic Number (Sales Efficiency) in the early years. This is not a defect but a characteristic of the **Consumption Model**. Snowflake incurs 100% of the CAC upfront, but revenue "ramps" over time. The model validates that this inefficiency is temporary, recouped via high NRR.
* **The Valuation Gap:**
    * My intrinsic valuation ($190) is lower than the market price. This suggests the market is pricing Snowflake as a "Safe Haven" asset with a lower risk premium, or pricing in an extended period of hyper-growth (10+ years) driven by AI/Data Cloud adoption.
